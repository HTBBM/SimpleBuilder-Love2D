* Your game directory made with [Love2D](https://love2d.org/)
* A game made with `11.5 Love2D 32 bits` version (see bellow if you are using a other version)

### How this works?
* Go to `your love2d game directory` -> `select all files` -> `compress to zip` -> change `.zip` to `.love`

## And... if this dont works with me? Why I need to do?
ok... you can try this:

### Update to your love2d version

* Delete all files inside of `LoveFiles`
* Go to [Love2D](https://love2d.org/) page
* Install the latest **zipped** version
* Extract the files of the downloaded version on `LoveFiles` folder
